# Week 8 Homework

Hi Mentees,

Welcome to Week 8!  We're really getting into the weeds now and are going to have a bunch of fun moving forward.  The next few weeks focus solely on Active Directory and how we can exploit it.  To be able to do this, we're going to set up a mini-AD lab.  Please download the following ISO's:

Server 2016: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016

Windows 10: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise

We will be installing these on stream, including setting up the AD environment.  Please do not work ahead as there are configuration changes that need to be made prior to boot!

The majority of the night will be focused on the AD install along with whatever hacking techniques we can squeeze in.  It will feel a little different than most nights, but is a necessary step towards our success and will help you understand how a domain is built out.  This is great experience if you've never touched AD before.

I look forward to seeing everyone Wednesday! :heart:

TCM
