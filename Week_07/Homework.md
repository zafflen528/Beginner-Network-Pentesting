# Week 7 Homework

Hi Mentees,

Welcome to Week 7!  We’re finally at the exploitation part of our course :).  We'll be covering the following topics tonight:

-Finding, compiling, and using exploits

-Exploitation w/ Metasploit

-What to do when we find nothing

For our exercise, we’ll be using Kioptrix Level 1 (https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/) again.  Please ensure you have it downloading and running (just like last week).  

From there, we will dive into some ideas about what we can do (especially in a limited scope) on an external engagement that has no exploitable findings.  If you haven't already, please check out my talk on credential stuffing from CarolinaCon (https://youtu.be/T0fEjnc_oes) and have breach-parse/password list (https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse) downloaded to your system.

This is our last week of external exploitation.  We'll soon be moving into internal AD exploitation, which is where things really get juicy.

I look forward to seeing everyone tonight! :heart:

TCM
