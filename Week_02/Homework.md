# Week 2 Homework

Howdy Mentees,

You made it through week 1!  Week 2 is going to be all about Python.  As a reminder, we will be starting at 8PM EST on https://www.twitch.tv/thecybermentor.

If you want to be ahead of the class, I have some extracurricular work for you.  I highly recommend running through some of the material provided as it will give you a strong foundation in what we will be covering and seeing the same material twice will help reinforce the concepts.  Do not be overwhelmed as you do not need to be proficient in Python to be a good pentester!

First, review the videos from this course (you need a Cybrary account -- it's free. *UPDATE: This may no longer be free*):

Second, try your hand at some coding challenges:

This should be enough to hold you over until Wednesday.  Happy learning!
