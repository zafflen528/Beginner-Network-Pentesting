# Week 10 & 11 Homework

Hi all,

I ran out of e-mail blast credits, so you special people in the Discord get the last announcement.

Week 10 is upon us and is the penultimate week.  We will be covering AD exploitation, part 3.  Good news: I asked for you all to upvote Active and Blue on HTB and you did it!  So, we'll be covering MS17-010, GPP/cPasswords, Kerberoasting, and some more Metasploit reinforcement.  The lesson will only take an hour (or maybe a tad longer), so the night should end early for us. 

Finally, week 11 will be on TUESDAY, May 28th.  This will be our last week.  We will be covering maintaining access/pivoting/cleanup for ~45 minutes and documentation/reporting for ~45 minutes.  Maybe we can come up with a fun drinking game for the last episode.

I look forward to seeing you all tomorrow night :)
