# Week 5 Homework

Howdy Mentees,

Welcome to week 5!  This week, we're going to be covering all things scanning.  Our topics will look something like so:

-TCP vs UDP Connections

-The 3-Way Handshake

-Scanning Tools & Tactics

-AMA

You'll be getting some exposure to tools such as Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, Burp Suite, and more.  Have an IP or two you can scan in your house.  Other than that, we'll be focusing on what we can do via the web.

I'll also give you a glimpse into the Pro versions of Nessus and Burp as well.  To see what capabilities they truly have.

I look forward to seeing you tomorrow (4/17/19) at 8PM EST!
