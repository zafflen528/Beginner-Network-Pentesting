# Week 3 Homework

Howdy Mentees,

You made it through a week of Python and asked for more.  You crazy kids.  Week 3 is going to touch on some more Python concepts that we couldn't fit into last week's course.

The homework is the same as last week:

Lastly, I have one "extra credit" ask for all of you.  If you're enjoying the course/Twitch/YouTube, please share them with a friend, Twitter, Reddit, or however you choose.  I'd love to continue growing this channel and keep providing content and courses you want to see.  Word of mouth goes a long way in helping that happen.

Thanks so much for your support and showing up every week.  I'll see you all this Wednesday.  Happy learning!
