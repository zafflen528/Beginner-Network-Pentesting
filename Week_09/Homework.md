# Week 9 Homework

Hi Mentees,

We're in the home stretch.  Last week, we covered building an AD lab and LLMNR poisoning.  This week, we're going to continue our AD fun.  What I need from you is:

1) Read this article: https://medium.com/@adam.toscher/top-five-ways-i-got-domain-admin-on-your-internal-network-before-lunch-2018-edition-82259ab73aaa.  It does a great job of discussing the most common internal methods we use in pentesting.

2) Install a second Windows 10 machine (I understand some of you may be RAM-limited).  We will worry about creating a new user and joining the domain when live streaming.

A few side notes:

1) There will be no class Wednesday, May 29th.  Your mentor has a much-needed vacation.

2) I am hoping to wrap up the course by the end of the month.  These are the topics left that I'd like to cover:

-AD exploitation: NTLM relay, Token Impersonation, PSExec, Meterpreter (post modules, loading modules, getsystem, etc.), GPP/C-Passwords, and possibly more.
-Non-AD exploitation: Common priv-esc tools and techniques for Windows/Linux, pass-the-hash attacks, crackmapexec, outside-the-box thinking
-Pivoting lab
-Legal/Reporting

I may cheat a bit and use a couple of boxes from HackTheBox.  If you have a VIP account, please upvote "Active" and "Blue" as they will allow me to show additional methods with limit lab build-out.

3) Because we have no class on the 29th, we will likely do one or two streams on the Monday and Tuesday before.  I've honestly not lesson planned that far out, but please know that you're in the home stretch!

I look forward to seeing everyone Wednesday! :heart:

TCM
