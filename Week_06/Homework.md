# Week 6 Homework

Hi Mentees,

Welcome to Week 6!  We’re starting to get into the weeds now, as we dive into the most important concept of ethical hacking: enumeration.  We’ll have a lot to cover in a short period of time.  The goal is to cover common ports discovered during a port scan, such as:

-HTTP/HTTPS

-SSH

-SMB

We’ll be focusing mainly on the process, tools, and exploit discovery more than deep diving specific protocol enumeration.  For our exercise, we’ll be using Kioptrix Level 1 (https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/).  After that, we will randomly pick an active box from Hack The Box and attempt to enumerate it.

Please ensure you have Kioptrix Level 1 downloaded and that your system can handle multiple VMs running at the same time.  If it cannot, this may be an exercise that you just watch and take notes.  If you do not have a Hack The Box account, you can attempt to hack the access code before tomorrow in order to follow along.  If not, again, you’ll just have to watch and take notes.

Finally, I’m seeing a small decline in numbers as we get into more technical concepts.  This was to be expected as hacking is intriguing as a concept, but not for everyone.  However, if you are feeling discouraged, please don’t give up.  It’s those who push forward that make the best hackers in our field.

I look forward to seeing everyone tomorrow! :heart:
